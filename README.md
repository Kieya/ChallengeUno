# **Challenge Number One - Horiseon**
This projects exists as an exercise in agile web development. Given a specific working directory
our mission, should we have accepted it, was to increase the *accessibility* of the website. In
addition we were to practice the *Scout Rule* to leave the code looking nicer than what we came upon.

What was completed during this exercise:
* Semantic HTML added
* Navigation elements fixed
* Elements follow a logical order
* Alt Attributes added
* Title added
* HTML and CSS cleaned up, unnecessary elements fixed or removed
